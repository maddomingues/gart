1) THE GART ALGORITHM

The gart algorithm is composed by the files generalize.pl, ARigart.pm, ARrule.pm and ARtaxonomy.pm.

To run the gart algorithm, call "perl generalize.pl <rule_base> <side of generalization (left or right)> [-onlyreport] [-sort]"

Using the data in the directory test_data, we can run the algorithm by calling "perl generalize.pl test_data/test left"



2) DIRECTORY "convert"

In the directory convert, we have a perl script (test.pl) which convert the output of several association rules algorithm to the standard format presented above.



3) DIRECTORY "text_data"

The directory text_data contains an example of input data used by the gart algorithm.


teste.apr.data - Data set used to generate the rules. Each line represents a transaction (basket) where the itens are separated by space.


teste.apr.dcar - Rules set generated by applying a typical association rules algorithm (e.g., apriori). Each line represents a rule and contains:

ID of the rule, LHS (left hand side of the rule), RHS (right hand side of the rule), [ relative frequency of (LHS RHS), relative frequency of (LHS notRHS), relative frequency of (notLHS RHS), relative frequency of (notLHS notRHS), number of transactions in the teste.apr.data file ]

In the directory convert, we have a perl script (test.pl) which convert the output of several association rules algorithm to the standard format presented above.


teste.tax - Each line in this file represents a taxonomy where the descendent items are between parenthesis "()". For instance: ancestral_item(descendent1, descendent2,...)
